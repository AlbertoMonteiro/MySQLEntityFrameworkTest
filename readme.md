### Using Entity Framework with Migrations and MySQLThis is a simple project that I did for test this combination. Its working but there are some limitations.I tested many mysql nuget packages to work togheter with EF with migrations working properly, and the only one that I did work is 	Install-Package MySql.Data.Entity### Limitations- Entity Framework version should be 5- I must create another Project(class library) to have EF and MySQL stuff, like models, contexto and also migrations.
